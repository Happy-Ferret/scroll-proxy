# scroll-proxy

This package is designed to help deal with the scroll event in the browser. It helps making scroll-dependent UI elements without taking much of a performance hit.

The project is coming soon, check the dev branch for unstable (not ready) stuff.

# Building

**It is not yet ready but the skeleton is here.**

If you know [grunt]() you may hack already :smile:.
